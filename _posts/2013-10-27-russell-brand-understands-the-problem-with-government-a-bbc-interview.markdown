I admit, I clicked a link to [a Gawker article][] that a friend of mine had
posted on Facebook earlier today. But! It was for good reason.

I am a big fan of Russell Brand (he's witty and splendidly learned) and to see
him discuss politics is like a dream come true in many ways. In this video,
Jeremy Paxman interviews Brand on the topic of his new role as [guest editor of
the _New Statesman_][] for the issue coming out October 24th. Instead of his new
position, the conversation revolves around the grand change Brand sees for the
order of the socioeconomic world, even calling for a complete upheaval of the
present political system that oppresses the poor, working classes and rewards
the aristocratic rich and powerful for this oppression.

Brand's ideas are radical in a political sense, but I'd agree that they're
necessary if we wish to see a world of happy, healthy human beings in the next
century. I'll be keeping an eye on him and supporting him every step of the way.
