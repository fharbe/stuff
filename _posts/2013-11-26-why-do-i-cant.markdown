![WHY DO I CAN'T](/mirrors/why.png)

I had a great coworker back in Germany who had the most glorious English. He
spoke well but was unmistakably German. One of my favourite sayings of his is
"Why do I can't?", which presumably meant "Why can't I?" [Chad Fowler][]
memorialized this superb phrase in the lovely image you see above. :heart:
