Abraham Lincoln delivered, in Springfield, Illinois on June 16, 1858, his very
famous "House Divided" speech. It discusses the tensions between the North and
South (this speech precedes the American Civil War by a couple years) and calls
his fellow senators to stand firm against the faltering of the Union.
